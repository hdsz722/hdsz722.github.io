            Turbo Tax
            <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com">Website</a>
            <img src="../images/turbotax-screenshot.png" target="_blank"  alt="mobile screenshot of turbotax site">
            <p>This sight is very clean and simple to see what is going on. There is ample space between sections and teh graphics 
                that are displayed on the screen into the next page.
            </p>
            <p>The page is not cluttered with content.  I found it very easy to follow and it makes the message very clear to the
                user.

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            All Recipes
            <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">Website</a>
            <img src="../images/allrecipies-screenshot.png" target="_blank" alt="mobile screenshot of google earth website">
            <p>This site uses Hick's Law effectively help the reader find things quickly.  The first row of images allows 
                the reader to scroll sideways to select suggested recipes easily.  The next group allows the reader to break
                down the opetions of recipes by categories.
            </p>
            <p>The site also allows the user to personalize the user's home page for even easier access to their favorite foods.  
                At the top of the site are easy to find and navigate icons to recieve notifications, search for items, 
                access and update the user profile, and lastly a menu icon to direct the user to other portions of the site.
            </p>

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            UAF Alaska Earthquake Center
            <a href="https://earthquake.alaska.edu/">Website</a>
            <img src="../images/alaska-earthquake-center-screenshot.png" target="_blank"  alt="mobile screenshot of uaf earthquake center site">
            <p>On this site, I found that they used visual heirarchy to bring the users attention to important piecces first. 
                drawing attention to the map to identify areas where there were the most earthquakes.  Then the reader goes down into
                the list of the latest earthquakes.
            </p>
            <p>The reader can then scoll down and find out information about preparing for earthquakes and how to keep themselves
                and their families safe.
            </p>
            <p>The one thing I did notice on this site was for the small screensize of a mobile phone, the menu icon is pretty small and
                hard to select.
